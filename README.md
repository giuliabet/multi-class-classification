# multi-class-classification
Multi-class classification problem with CIFAR-100 subset.

In this section the problem of Multi-class classification is analyzed by using traditional Machine Learning models.
The goal is to evaluate the different techniques regarding multi-class scenarios and try to understad their strengths and limitations.
Through metrics and performances' evaluation, the research aims to define their implementationa and identify optimizazion areas.

The exploited dataset is the animals' subset obtained by grouping 4 different animal superclasses in CIFAR-100. 

The models used are:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

On each model is applied One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One approach.
